The secret to business success: customer centricity

In the business world, the pursuit of business success is the goal of every business. However, achieving business success is not easy. Successful companies have one thing in common: they put their customers first. Doing so can help companies better understand customer needs and provide customized services and products.
Customer centricity means understanding the needs of your customers, including their problems, pain points, and expectations. When designing a product or service, it is essential to take these needs into account and create solutions that are truly valuable. At the same time, it is essential to communicate with customers, collect feedback and continuously improve products and services.
Another important aspect of focusing on customer needs is building long-term partnerships. This requires maintaining good communication and trust with customers to establish a reliable brand image. This will help attract new customers and retain old ones, as well as gain an edge in a competitive market.
In conclusion, customer centricity is the key to business success. If a business always pays attention to customer needs and provides high-quality products and services, it can win the trust and loyalty of customers and achieve business success.

##### 1. 游戏
xp3文件是游戏资源包文件
1、想打开此类资源包，必须对资源文件包进行解包。
2、解包就是将加密封装的游戏所用图片素材解密拆散还原成图像形式。
3、解包的第一步就是确认要解包的资源文件——要将哪个文件拆开，获取里面的素材。确认目标文件时，要注意目标文件的后缀，这在一定程度上会告诉这个文件解包的难度。
4、xp3文件的解包，推荐使用XP3 Viewer。



后排提个醒：想要自己提取游戏资源包的请使用解包软件对游戏主体文件（如我的是汉化硬盘版本的，游戏主体是xp3文件）进行解包，出现的新文件夹就是解包资源。data是游戏主体，voice是游戏人声，data里面的bgm就是背景音乐，剩余的，大家自己探索吧！另：解包出来的音频是ogg可以用格式工厂转换成mp3。
另：我的版本里sound是音效




1.启动Xp3Viewer 直接双击程序是不行的，需要将游戏程序图标(如果汉化和原版是两个图标的话，拖动原版)拖动到Xp3Viewer图标的上面，这时候鼠标会出现“使用Xp3Viewer打开”，松手，程序顺利打开。此时游戏也会打开，不过没有用处，可以关闭。

2.用Xp3Viewer解包 在打开Xp3Viewer后，将游戏文件夹里的data.xp3拖到Xp3Viewer上面的框里，程序会自动开始解包。成果储存在游戏文件夹里新生成生成的data文件夹中。

3.结果 解包完成后，打开data文件夹，里面就是整个游戏所有的资源。其中标题曲是bgm文件夹中的title.ogg。不光BGM，所有的CG、语音、形象、封面、甚至转场画面都有。注意：音乐与语音的格式为.ogg,若无法播放可以尝试转换文件格式。



.ogg 转 .mp3
ffmpeg -i a.ogg a.mp3
批量:
set origin=D:\music\ogg
forfiles /P %origin% /M *.ogg /C "cmd /c ffmpeg -i @file @fname.mp3"

ffmpeg -i a.ogg a.mp3命令可以将a.ogg转换为a.mp3，
如果我们想批量转换某个文件夹下的所有ogg文件为mp3就可以按照上面那样写，
设定origin为ogg源文件夹，然后逐个转换为mp3后保存到当前目录。

我默不作声。这是她们绝对不曾有过的时光。成了大人后，即使与谁在一起，也经常不得不在心里留意一下其他事情。<break time="1000ms" />曾经，与家人共处的时光并非是这样的。不管是好事还是坏事，我都只要去想着在场的人就足够了。曾经的时光就是这样单纯的。那是我已经失去的，而她们不曾拥有的东西，现在让我们将彼此称呼为家人，从而尽己所能地去表演这场虚幻的故事吧。<break time="5000ms" />


每当夜幕降临，我总会感到无尽的孤独和悲伤。<break time="500ms" />我的内心深处，充满了一种无法言喻的伤感情绪。或许是因为过去的遗憾，或许是因为未来的不确定，我总是觉得自己被困在黑暗的角落中。那些美好的记忆，在我的脑海中缓缓浮现，然后又像泡沫一样消散。我试着去寻找一个出口，但却发现自己陷入了更深的迷茫之中。我渴望有人能听到我的呼唤，能理解我的痛苦，<break time="500ms" />但是我却只能独自承受这份刻骨铭心的伤痛。或许生命就是这样，充满了起起伏伏，有时候充满了欢笑，有时候却沉浸在无尽的悲伤之中。


即便如此我们还是坐在对方的身旁，静静地保持现状。这是抛弃与拾起的循环。<break time="1000ms" />我们之间的关系其实随时都可能被破坏，随时都可能被抛弃。同时这种关系随时都能再次建立起来，随时都能重新拾起来。<break time="1000ms" />但是，无法永远同在。毕竟人与其所有物永远无法融为一体。<break time="1000ms" />…………但是——有时又会猛然惊觉。以至于惊慌失措。我觉得这样有什么地方错了。有什么东西粗暴地闯入了我的认知，让我对自己惊讶不已。你也一定对自身的存在感到过惊讶吧。对自己还未死去感到惊讶。会被那不知何处突然冒出来的情绪拉扯着，扪心自问究竟为何还活着
